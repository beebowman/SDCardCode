//Code By: Bo Bowman
//This code connects toggle switch, LED, and SD card (microSD card) together on a breadboard. 
//Includes Fritzing diagram 

//Connect wiring as follows: https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/GeneralSpud/toggle-switch-3763a2 
//Connect switch pin to 3 (instead of pin 4 from the above url) 
//Connect led pin to 9 (instead of pin 5 from the above url) 
//Use a 220 Ohm resistor for the LED
//Use a 1k Ohm resistor for the toggle switch 

//Used Arduino Uno R3 
//Used 128GB SD card 
//Used an SD Card Reader (microSD card reader), purchased here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06ZYXR7DL/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1 
//Used a standard MicroSD card adapter board with CS (chipselect), SCK, MOSI, MISO, VCC pins on it. You can also buy one from adafruit here: https://www.adafruit.com/product/254?gclid=CjwKCAjwu5yYBhAjEiwAKXk_eB9RXsR5mKURYSPj84TBgerp9w3ubaqiiiWZdjVea9gIhsvzKWevyBoCCk4QAvD_BwE
//Used these instructions for wiring: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-micro-sd-breakout-board-card-tutorial/arduino-library 
//IMPORTANT: You must format your 128GB SD card prior to using it!! 
//Initialize the SD card to FAT 16 using the following instructions for Mac OSX:  
//http://arquivo.splat-n.com/scripts/format-a-flash-card-as-fat16-in-mac-os-x/ 
//See here for additional code on reading and writing data to a MicroSD card: https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/electropeak/sd-card-module-with-arduino-how-to-read-write-data-37f390

//Wiring for the SD card: 
//Connect CS to pin 10
//Connect SCK to pin 13 
//Connect MOSI to pin 11
//Connect MISO to pin 12
//Connect VCC along the + line of the breadboard, to the right of the wire that connects the + line to 5V pin on the Arduino (the left side should go to the toggle switch) 
//Connect GND to pin GND 

// Rocker on/off switch (basic toggle switch) from Amazon

//Initialization Code for LED and toggle switch 
int switch_pin = 3; 
int led_pin = 9; 

//Initialization Code for ID card 
#include <SPI.h>
#include <SD.h>
File myFile;

void setup() {
  //setup code runs only once

  //Setup Code for switch & LED 
  pinMode(switch_pin, INPUT); //set mode for pin switch 3 to input 
  pinMode(led_pin,OUTPUT); //set mode for led pin 9 to output 

  //Setup Code for SD Card 
  
    // This code helps prevent error during SD card initiliazation. Note that you also must reformat your MicroSD card to FAT 16 format with a USB MicroSD adapter prior to using this code! 
  pinMode(10,OUTPUT); // set pin (the CS pin for the MicroSD card adapter board) to pin 10, and set it as Output mode 
  digitalWrite(10,HIGH); //initialize the CS pin of the MicroSD card adapter board to HIGH 

  // Open serial communications and wait for port to open:
  Serial.begin(9600);

  while (!Serial) {
    ; // wait for serial port to connect. Needed for native USB port only
  }
  Serial.print("Initializing SD card...");
  if (!SD.begin(10)) {
    Serial.println("initialization failed!");
    while (1);
  }
  Serial.println("initialization done.");
  // open the file. note that only one file can be open at a time,
  // so you have to close this one before opening another.
  myFile = SD.open("test.txt", FILE_WRITE);
  // if the file opened okay, write to it:
  if (myFile) {
    Serial.print("Writing to test.txt...");
    myFile.println("This is a test file :)");
    myFile.println("testing 1, 2, 3.");
    for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
        myFile.println(i);
    }
    // close the file:
    myFile.close();
    Serial.println("done."); 
  } 
  else {
    // if the file didn't open, print an error:
    Serial.println("error opening test.txt");
  }
  
 
}

void loop() {
  // main code here runs repeatedly:

  if (digitalRead(switch_pin) == HIGH){
    digitalWrite(led_pin,LOW);
    
  }
  if (digitalRead(switch_pin)==LOW){
    digitalWrite(led_pin,HIGH);
  }
